== Description ==

The plugin shows a warning in the WordPress administration header when the option "Search Engine Visibility: Discourage search engines from indexing this site" is enabled.

**It's very important when moving a website from staging or development to production to remember to switch this option off. Or even better never switch it on.**

> SETTINGS / READING "Search Engine Visibility: Discourage search engines from indexing this site": Checking this box tells search engines to completely avoid inspecting / indexing the site's contents, meaning that the site will not show up in search results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make this plugin?  =
We often develop websites on staging or development servers. Sometimes the developers go to SETTINGS / READING and check "Search Engine Visibility: Discourage search engines from indexing this site" because they think it will help them not becoming indexed by a search engine.
Much better than using this option (**which by the way you should never use**) you should install a Maintenance plugin like [Maintenance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/maintenance/) and activate the option "503: Service temporarily unavailable, Google analytics will be disable".

= Does Search engines blocked warning make changes to the database? =
No. The plugin doesn't write any options or settings to the database.

= How can I check out if the plugin works for me? =
Install and activate. If the "Search Engine Visibility: Discourage search engines from indexing this site" option is selected you will see a WARNING in the header.

= How can I remove Search engines blocked warning? =
You can simply activate, deactivate or delete it in your plugin management section. There are no options stored in the database so you can delete it also via FTP and everything will be removed.

= Are there any known incompatibilities? =
Please don't use it with *WordPress MultiSite*, as it has not been tested.

= Which PHP version do I need? =
This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.6 and greater. WordPress itself [recommends using PHP version 7.2 or greater](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). If you're using a PHP version lower than 5.6 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.

= Are there any server requirements? =
Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.6 or higher and we recommend using PHP version 7.1 or higher. The plugin has been tested with PHP up to 7.2.

= Do you make use of Search engines blocked warning yourself? = 
Of course we do. That's why we created it. ;-)
